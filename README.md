# Fire Walker
## Or maybe just Walker.

Walker is an application for tracking how many steps a user takes each day, the goals that they set for themselves for each day, and what percentage of that goal they acheive. In addition to tracking the information, the application should eventually gamify the process in order to encourage good habits.

The application is hosted [here](https://walker-firebase.firebaseapp.com/), uses jQuery, Handlebars, and Circliful on the client side, and Firebase for backend-as-a-service. There is no server-side component.

### Release History
1.0.0.3 (24-Nov-2016): Minimum viable featureset. User can track today's steps and goal by entering them manually and is shown the percentage of that goal that has been acheived on a ring graph.
