# Fire Walker
## Or maybe just Walker.

Walker is an application for tracking how many steps a user takes each day, the goals that they set for themselves for each day, and what percentage of that goal they acheive. In addition to tracking the information, the application should eventually gamify the process in order to encourage good habits.
